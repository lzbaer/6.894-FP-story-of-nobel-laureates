# FP-The-Stories-of-High-Achievers

## Project Process
We started to brainstorm about the ideas of how to tell the stories of Nobel prize winner and we looked at different examples to get inspired. After looking at different ways to visualize our data, we decided on the story and created two different scenarios which were aggregative data visualization, and scrolly telling with individual graph visualization. Then, We did an exploratory analysis of the data using different platforms and created the basic of our ideas and improved the design of our graphs and visualization by adding features like filter bar, legend box, and a summary window.
