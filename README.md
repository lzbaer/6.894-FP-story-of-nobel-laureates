# FP-The-Stories-of-High-Achievers
**Lisa Baer, Ameneh Fadaie, Austin Parker**

## Project Process
We started to brainstorm about the ideas of how to tell the stories of Nobel prize winner and we looked at different examples to get inspired. After looking at different ways to visualize our data, we decided on the story and created two different scenarios which were aggregative data visualization, and scrolly telling with individual graph visualization. Then, we did an exploratory analysis of the data using different platforms and created the basic of our ideas and improved the design of our graphs and visualization by adding features like filter bar, legend box, and a summary window. 

## Individual Contributions
### Ameneh
- Data wrangling (Tableau and Excel)
- Visualization in Observable (D3 and Vega-Lite) for the basic idea
- Creating scenarios and stories for data visulization
- Visualization design 
- Paper and presentation file

### Lisa
- Wrote Python scripts to collect data from the Nobel Laureate REST API (https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/), join data with publication records dataset (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0033-6), and filter out laureates with missing data
- Implemented initial chord diagram using D3 and Python to experiment with aggregate view of laureates and countries (not included in final deployed application). Used Python to determine top countries and resolve slight differences in country names
- Designed and implemented flower visualization and scrollytelling using D3 and javascript. Designed and implemented interactive components and animations
- Validated the number of publication records displayed in the application using the Microsoft Academic database (https://academic.microsoft.com/home)
- Final paper
