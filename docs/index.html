      <h2>When you think of a Nobel Prize Winner who do you visualize? what type of person appears in your head?</h2>
      <h2>What are common conditions and environments that may facilitate <strong> scientific creativity</strong>?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Let's begin by examining <strong>David J. Thouless</strong>, a 2016 nobel laureate awarded for his research in <italic>"theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter"</italic>.</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="div1.5">
      <h2>Where do Nobel Prize Winners come from?  Are they immigrants or do they stay in their home country?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>The <strong>background color</strong> represents <strong>mobility</strong>, which we define as whether the laureate won the award while researching in a different country from which they were born.</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Thouless was born in the United Kingdom, and won the Nobel Prize while working at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. This means that Thouless migrated. </h2>
    </div>
    <div id="div2">
      <h2>How old is a Nobel Prize Winner?  Did they make their contribution to humanity while they were young?  Or did it take years of hard work?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>The <strong>shape</strong> of the petal represents the <strong>age</strong> of the laureate when they received the award. We divide age groups into four buckets: 0-25 years old, 25-50 years old, 50-75 years old, and 75-100 years old. The four petal shapes become increasingly pointy as the age bracket it represents increases. </h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Thouless was <strong> 82 years old</strong> when he won the Nobel Prize, so he belongs in the 75-100 year age bucket, represented by the pointiest petal shape. </h2>
    </div>
    <div id="div3">
      <h2>In what category did they win their award?  There are many categories to contribute to: Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Economics.</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>The <strong>color</strong> of the petal represents the <strong>field</strong> in which the nobel laureate won the prize.</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Thouless won the Nobel Prize in <strong>Physics</strong>.</h2>
      <p></p>
    </div>
    <div id="div4">
      <h2>What contribution did this winner make to their field?  Was it a single act or near countless contributions?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>The <strong>number of petals</strong> represents the <strong>number of publications</strong> the laureate has published up until receiving the award.The number of petals range from 3 to 6 and the addition of a petal increases the number of publications logarithmically.</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Thouless published <strong>143</strong> publications, so his flower has <strong>5</strong> petals. </h2>
    </div>
    <div id="div6">
      <h2> Did the winner get there by themselves or was it only possible through collaboration with others?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2><strong>Leaves</strong> represent <strong>collaboration</strong>, which we define as whether the laureate shared the prize. </h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Thouless shared his award with <strong> F. Duncan M. Haldane</strong> and <strong>J. Michael Kosterlitz</strong>.</h2>
    </div>
    <!--
    <div id="div7">
      <h2>The <strong>length of the stem</strong> represents <strong>age</strong>. The longer the stem, the older a laureate was when they received the award. </h2>
      <h2>Thouless was <strong> 82 years old</strong> when he won the Nobel Prize.</h2>
