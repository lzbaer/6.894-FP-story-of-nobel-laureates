## Summary Image

## Abstract
How do we frame the stories of high- achievers as a way to inspire innovation as opposed to alienating the viewer. 
We will visualize nobel prize winners from multiple fields and highlight their backgrounds to show what led them to that point.
Expanding from the visualization of an individual Nobel Prize winner to the visualization of the many winners throughout the 
years we will show the diversity of the many winners and the many places they came from.  Additionally, this will highlight
many accomplishments of the various winners and give viewers an outlet to learn more about any Nobel Prize Winner that piques 
their interest.
